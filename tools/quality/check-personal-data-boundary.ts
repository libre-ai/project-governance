/**
 * Personal-data boundary guard (ADR-0012, invariant I-21).
 *
 * This repository publishes CODE — engines, contracts, schemas, curation rules.
 * It never publishes INSTANCE DATA. Curated items about organisations live in a
 * private Radar tenant behind RLS; anything about a natural person lives only on
 * the owner's device, inside Notebook, under a non-exportable key. Neither ever
 * reaches a public commit.
 *
 * `DATA-PROVENANCE.md` already states that policy — "data with unresolved
 * provenance, privacy or redistribution rights is not published" — but a policy
 * with no instrument is a convention, and conventions lose. This scanner is the
 * instrument. It fails closed: it over-blocks by design, and every exemption is a
 * named, justified entry rather than a pattern loosened until the gate goes quiet.
 *
 * Two independent signals, because the two accidents differ:
 *
 * 1. `scanDatasetPaths` — a real dataset entered the tree. This is the likely
 *    accident of a dogfooding session: an OPML subscription export, a curated
 *    NDJSON dump, a whole working directory pasted in "just to test". Judged on
 *    the path alone, so a binary blob is caught without reading it.
 * 2. `scanPersonalIdentifiers` — an identifier was pasted into authored prose or
 *    source. Judged line by line, one finding per line.
 *
 * What it does NOT do, stated so nobody mistakes its silence for proof: it cannot
 * recognise a person's name, an inferred opinion, or an organisational affiliation
 * written in plain sentences — which is precisely the Article 9 material the ADR
 * governs. That material is kept out by architecture (Notebook is local-only and
 * has no outbound primitive, enforced by `check-no-transmission.ts`) and by the
 * sourced-facts-only rule on person records. This gate stops the accidental and
 * the obvious paste, not authored prose about a human being.
