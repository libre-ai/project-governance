/**
 * WP-G2-Q01 acceptance criterion 2, the tree-wide "secret" gate: no committed
 * credential (cloud key, VCS/CI token, private key, etc.) appears in a living
 * surface. The credential detection is delegated to containsCredentialMarker
 * (credential-only sibling of the contract PII scanner, same decoding
 * hardening, already covered by public-source-scanner's tests) — this file is
 * only the scope + reporting shell, so the patterns live in exactly one place.
 * Email/URL identifiers are intentionally out of scope here: an example
 * address in a scanner fixture is not a committed credential.
 *
 * Excluded: the detector source (it holds the patterns), this gate's own test
 * and the schema-fixtures vector corpus (both carry anti-pattern fixtures by
 * design, already validated in their own context by check-contracts),
 * non-normative review evidence (docs/reviews and any evidence directory), and
 * the usual build or vendored trees. File exclusions are exact paths — an
 * unanchored suffix would let any same-named path inherit the exemption — and
 * a fixture that must carry a positive detection case on a non-reserved host
 * (e.g. the no-clever gate's own canary) exempts its single line with the
 * greppable `secret-scan:allowed-fixture` marker instead of its whole file
 * (K4 review of f49fc18, finding 4: file-wide exemptions silently unscanned
 * every other vendor-token form).
